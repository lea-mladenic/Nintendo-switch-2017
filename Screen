The Switch’s 6.2-inch, multi-touch, 720p LCD screen is a beauty. Color production is vibrant, and it’s bright enough to be played in 
indirect sunlight. Its generous viewing angles are a huge boon too, with a sweet spot large enough to make keeping an ideal picture easy. 
And even if you stray out of it, the picture remains visible in a roughly 120-degree arc – which is necessary when you’re playing
multiplayer games in tabletop mode. Its touch functionality is leaps and bounds beyond the Wii U’s too, 
making it feel in line with the kinds of touch interfaces we’ve all grown accustomed to interacting with on iPads and Android tablets.
