Nintendo Switch isn’t unlike a NASA spacecraft, in that nearly every part of it has been specially designed to pull double or even triple
duty. The system’s modular design means that it has to function as a traditional home console, a portable system, and stand-alone
touchscreen tablet with wireless controllers. Getting a piece of hardware to do that much while also making it easy to use and understand 
would be an engineering miracle, and although Nintendo has come close in some regards, it has fallen well short in others. Overall, 
the Switch is an attractive and powerful but oversized portable gaming system that struggles to be a convincing or reliable home console.
