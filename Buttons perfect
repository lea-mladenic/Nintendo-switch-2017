The smallish face buttons are sufficiently clicky and easy to hit, but the lack of a traditional D-pad or full-sized analog triggers will 
put it at a disadvantage for certain types of games. The Minus button (think Select or Back) is very oddly placed, though:
itâ€™s so small and so close to the left analog stick that I can barely hit the button without nudging the stick.
